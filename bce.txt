So the 6th question during the survey was asked that if communalism was politicized,so the response for this was very positive i.e 61.4% people  agreed to it i.e the commulism is more about politics and less about religion and also 33.6% people weren't sure about this.Coming to the 7th question was while scrolling social media do we come across fake news and also fake messages that were vilifying people belonging to a certain commmunity,so the reaction of the people for this was absolutely Yes and this can lead to hatred among the people to the particular community.
Coming to the 8th Question, Majority of the people agreed to the decision that government or politician should not use religion as a means of social control taking the ratio into considration about 90% of people agreed to it and 5% said that the politicians should use religion for political gain.
9th question was that what is the main cause for religious intolerance in india, actually we can say there are many factors causing religious intolerance in india but the main reason that come into play is the thoughts of the people i.e people mentality,.
Majority of the people haven't even bothered to take a step to promote inter religious harmony which can actually lower all the matters of religious intolerance in india but yes 25.1% of people think that they might have done some or the other work that might have promoted inter religious harmony.
